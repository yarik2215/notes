# CloudFormation

## Basic technical concepts of CloudFormation

- **Resources** – Any of the things you can create within AWS, which includes things like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (AmazonEC2) instances, or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues.
- **Templates** – Text-based (JSON or YAML) descriptions of CloudFormation stacks that you can use to define all of your resources, including which resources depend on each other. 
- **Stack** – A collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. 
- **StackSet** – A named set of stacks that use the same template, but applied across different accounts and Regions. You can create, update, or delete stacks across multipleaccounts and Regions with a single operation.
