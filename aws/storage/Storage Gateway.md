## When to consider hybrid cloud

The following four use cases summarize several key situations for when to consider hybrid cloud:

- You have an existing application that must run on premises, that uses databases or files, or that must perform backups, and you want to use cloud resources and scalability.
- You need fast, local access to data, but you also want to take advantage of cloud compute and analytics engines.
- You have yearsâ€™ worth of security and compliance requirements, supported by processes and procedures in disparate systems on premises. And you want to use cloud management and monitoring capabilities, ideally from a single pane of glass.
- You have many physical locations to manage with data and applications, and you want reliable connectivity and simplified maintenance.
